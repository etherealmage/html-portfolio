<h1>The Best Movies According to Lauren</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />


<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I love the characters and the plot. Calcifer is my favorite character because of his sass.</p>

<h3>Kiki's Delivery Service</h3>
<p>I like that the moral of the story is to keep going even if you have lost faith in your ability. You just have to find it again, which may come from just not worrying so much about it. Thinking too much will make everything harder</p>

<h3>Sailor Moon R: Power of the Rose</h3>
<p>I love that Sailor Moon is always doing what she believes is right even if it is at the cost of her life. She will do her best to save her friends and in some cases her enemies.</p>
